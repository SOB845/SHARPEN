# SHARPEN
With the daily rise of the Web 2.0, we find ourselves in need of new user accounts and more secure passwords. However, keeping these accounts information safe is always a pain in the ass. You might want to write your account information on a paper (which is way better than digital notes) but that's not the only problem. **How do you make sure your password is as strong as possible?** if you're not sure, then all other things doesn't matter. Your password is the heart of your web immunity and SHARPEN is here to protect it.

\SHARPEN is a console app for generating random passwords.
